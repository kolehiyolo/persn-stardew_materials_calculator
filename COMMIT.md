refactor App.tsx data fetch
1. just did some refactoring to better understand the fetching script
2. the major thing I am trying right now is making sure that I set types to ALL variables I'm using moving forward
3. this ought to help me prevent errors as I'm already setting ahead of time what the expected typings are and makes me forward-thinking about potential errors
