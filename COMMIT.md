build table with placeholder data
1. alright this now works, but there are certain caveats
2. it's difficult to style knowing that the components showing aren't final, and I don't wanna have to make fake icon placeholder shapes that are then just gonna be replaced almost immediately in the next commit
3. whatever the case, the table is ready, as styled as possible given the limitations, and now I think it's better if i just go ahead and try setting up materialsData to then pass to TableMaterials
