hey. so now I want to be able to render the images. each "Item" has the ff code:

<td
  className="Item"
>
  <div
    className="image"
  >
  </div>
  <div
    className="name"
  >
    {item.name}
  </div>
</td>

div.image is the one I'm using as a placeholder right now. I need it replaced with an image, with the URL following the imgURL of the item or material. my question is, what changes are needed for the div.image, and where do I put the actual images?
